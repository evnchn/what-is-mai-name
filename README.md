# what-is-mai-name
Custom names for friends on maimai DX net

## Install
1. Add `what-is-mai-name.userscript.js` into your favourite userscript manager
2. Done

**Note: If you were on `what-is-mai-name.userscriptV2.1.js`, the last release before auto-update was added, you need to reinstall.**

## Result

Pay attention to the blue header image in the friends page. 

Normally, there is no click action involved. This is why it has now been repurposed as a button.
